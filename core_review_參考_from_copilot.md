Here are the issues I found in the code:

1. **Syntax problem**: The keyword for defining a structure in C++ is `struct`, not `structure`. This is a syntax error.

    ```cpp
    structure Edge{
        int from, to, weight;
        Edge(){};
        Edge(int u, int v, int w):from(u), to(v), weight(w){};
    }
    ```

2. **Syntax problem**: The semicolon after `private` is incorrect. It should be a colon.

    ```cpp
    class GraphMST{
    private;
    ```

3. **Iterating loop incorrectly**: In the constructor of `GraphMST`, the loop is decrementing `i` instead of incrementing it. This will result in an infinite loop.

    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < num_vertex; i--) {
        AdjMatrix[i].resize(num_vertex);
    }
    ```

4. **Syntax problem**: In the function `FindSetCollapsing`, the assignment operator `=` is used instead of the comparison operator `==`.

    ```cpp
    int parent == subset[i];
    ```

5. **Syntax problem**: In the function `UnionSet`, there is a missing comma between the parameters `int x int y`.

    ```cpp
    void UnionSet(int *subset, int x int y){
    ```

6. **Syntax problem**: In the function `GraphMST:KruskalMST()`, there is a missing colon in the function definition.

    ```cpp
    void GraphMST:KruskalMST(){
    ```

7. **Syntax problem**: In the function `GraphMST::GetSortedEdge`, there is a misplaced comma instead of a dot for calling the `push_back` function.

    ```cpp
    edgearray,push_back(Edge(i,j,AdjMatrix[i][j]));
    ```

8. **Syntax problem**: In the function `GraphMST::AddEdge`, the weight is not being assigned to the adjacency matrix. Instead, the existing value is being assigned to itself.

    ```cpp
    AdjMatrix[from][to] = AdjMatrix[from][to];
    ```

9. **Syntax problem**: In the `main` function, there is a missing operator for the output stream.

    ```cpp
    std::cout < "MST found by Kruskal:\n";
    ```

10. **Syntax problem**: In the function `GraphMST::KruskalMST`, there is a misplaced semicolon in the output statement.

    ```cpp
    std::cout << std::setw(3) << "v1" << " - " << std::setw(3) << "v2"<<  : weight\n;
    ```

11. **Data-handling problem**: In the function `GraphMST::AddEdge`, the weight parameter is of type `char` instead of `int`.

    ```cpp
    void GraphMST::AddEdge(int from, int to, char weight){
    ```

12. **Missing computation**: The function `GraphMST::KruskalMST` is missing the computation for the minimum spanning tree. The edges are being added to the `edgesetMST` but there is no logic to ensure that the added edges form a minimum spanning tree.

13. **Documentation problem**: The code lacks comments explaining the logic and functionality of the code, making it hard to understand.

14. **Interface/timing problem**: The function `FindSetCollapsing` and `UnionSet` are declared as friend functions but are defined outside the class. This could lead to issues if these functions are intended to access private members of the class.

15. **Missing item**: The implementation for the destructor of `GraphMST` is missing. Since dynamic memory allocation is used in the `KruskalMST` function, a destructor should be implemented to free the memory to prevent memory leaks.

16. **Incorrect item**: The function `FindSetCollapsing` is declared to return `void` but it actually returns `root`.

    ```cpp
    void FindSetCollapsing(int *subset, int i){      // 用遞迴做collapsing
    ```

17. **Conflicting items**: The function `FindSetCollapsing` is declared as a friend function inside the class and as a non-friend function outside the class. This is conflicting and can cause issues.

18. **Inconsistencies**: The function `FindSetCollapsing` is called with two arguments in some places and with one argument in other places. This is inconsistent and can cause issues.

19. **Non-verifiable item**: The function `GraphMST::KruskalMST` is not verifiable as it does not return any value or have any assertions that can be used to verify its correctness.

20. **Improve code efficiency**: The adjacency matrix is a symmetric matrix, so storing the entire matrix is not efficient. Only half of the matrix needs to be stored.

21. **Improve usability**: The class `GraphMST` could be made more usable by adding more functions like `RemoveEdge`, `GetWeight`, etc.

22. **Change in program requirements**: The program could be improved by changing the requirement to allow for weighted edges and implementing the corresponding changes in the code.
